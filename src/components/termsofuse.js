<strong>Arbitration:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Any dispute between you and Buddha Thai Cuisine, its agents, employees,

affiliates arising from or relating to these Terms and Conditions and their
interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the
relationships which result from these Terms and Conditions, including
disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration
provision (collectively, “<strong>Covered Disputes</strong>”) will be
settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with
said rules. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will
give the other party at least 60-days’ advanced written notice of its intent
to file for arbitration. Buddha Thai Cuisine will provide such notice by
e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Buddha Thai Cuisine and you must
provide such notice by e-mail to&nbsp;
<a href="mailto:support@diningtek.com">support@diningtek.com</a>
</p>
<p>
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle
amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable
settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate
arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief
would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the
arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be
entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator
will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and Conditions
and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and
grounds for judicial review. Buddha Thai Cuisine and you agree that any
Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual
basis only. Neither Buddha Thai Cuisine nor you are entitled to arbitrate
any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action
and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class,
representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the
agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable,
the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding,
and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or
private attorney general arbitration).

these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, the invalidity of such
provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which

Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
condition or any other term or condition. Except as expressly provided in a
separate, written agreement between you and Buddha Thai Cuisine, these Terms
and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and Buddha Thai
Cuisine with respect to the Services, and supersede all discussions,
communications, conversations and agreements concerning the subject matters
